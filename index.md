# about me

Hey there! I'm Swarnadeep.

I'm currently working as a developer for Dell R&D where I mainly deal with developing and deploying APIs for the backend teams on cloud. I write code mainly in Java using the Spring boot framework. I'm still learning :)

I love python and C++. Something about them.

I'm curious about machine learning and distributed computing and you can see some of my projects at my <a href = "www.github.com/reallyoldturtle">git</a>. Fair a bit of them were done during my Masters program @ IIIT Hyderabad.

When I'm not in front of my laptop I'm probably playing football or killing it at FIFA. You can add me up at PS4 (henrypires49).

Wanna talk about a cool research paper or some open source projects or how 4-3-3 is losing its gloss? Hit me up at swarnadeep.chatterjee@gmail.com.
